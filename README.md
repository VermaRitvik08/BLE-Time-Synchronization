ECE 535 PROJECT PROPOSAL

Khushkumar Jajoo, Ritvik Verma, Anush Rathore

In our pursuit of this project, we find strong alignment with our collective background and interests. Each member of our team has undergone comprehensive coursework in the field of embedded systems, fostering a deep-seated passion for working with these specialized devices. Furthermore, our prior experiences with machine learning (ML) technologies have equipped us with a unique skill set that lends itself well to the successful execution of this endeavor.

Given our shared expertise in embedded systems and our basic knowledge in ML, we believe this project is not only well-suited to our capabilities but also an opportunity for us to leverage our knowledge effectively. This alignment of skills and interests positions us to excel in developing and implementing the proposed time synchronization protocol, thereby contributing to its success.

Motivation: The proposed project, centered around developing a time synchronization protocol for networked embedded devices, emerges from a convergence of critical technological needs and our team's unique skill set. Time synchronization plays a pivotal role in the functionality of various distributed applications, spanning smart homes, automated agriculture, and autonomous vehicles. Our motivation to embark on this project stems from several factors. Firstly, our team possesses a strong foundation in embedded systems, having gained experience with different microcontrollers. This expertise equips us with a deep understanding of the intricacies of embedded devices, making us well-suited to tackle the challenges of time synchronization in this domain. Furthermore, our background in basic machine learning algorithms complements the project's objectives. Machine learning can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of time synchronization, allowing us to explore innovative techniques for addressing clock drift and network delays.

Design goals:

Deliverables: • Characterize the network delay between raspberry pi and the edge device. • Estimate the relative clock drift between the participating devices.
